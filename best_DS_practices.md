- Learn OOPS concepts and apply them. Write OOP code after POC and put that into production
- Write clean code with good comments so that anyone can understand that
- Create pipeline for each and every module for DS lifecycle and have a final main function which triggers every pipeline in order
- Use google before doing any task and use best practices for that task so that productivity will increase and everyone can understand
- Place your learning, best practices etc at a place like Github for reusability and to reduce time next time
